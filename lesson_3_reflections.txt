When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I plan to work from different computers, have a backup, share work or collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because when I pull changes it will change some of the files in my local repository so I want to make sure I have commited all the changes I have made before doing a pull.
